# Iceberg-Tables

Iceberg is a high-performance format for huge analytic tables. Iceberg brings the reliability and simplicity of SQL tables to big data, while making it possible for engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Hive and Impala to safely work with the same tables, at the same time.

The Iceberg table format offers many features to help power your data lake architecture.

1. Expressive SQL
2. Schema evolution 
3. Partition evolution 
4. Time travel and rollback
5. Transactional consistency

To test these features, let us get started by running a local Spark instance with Iceberg integration using Docker. In this environment, we can explore Iceberg's above given features in Jupyter Notebook.
